# Project 5 - Neighborhood Map Application

## Udacity: Front-end Web Dev Nanodegree

### Project Overview

For this project, I developed a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood.  I added functionality to this map including locations of interest, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

### How To Use the App

To use this application, clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` document.  The map application will render in your browser.  You can explore the content by:

* Selecting the map markers displayed on the map
* Selecting the hamburger-menu icon in the upper left corner, then choosing a location from the list that displays
* The search functionality displaying above the list lets you filter locations by title
